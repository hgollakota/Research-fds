1 Introduction
  1.1 Collaborators
    This team is composed of Erik Wolf and Harry Gollakota, DePaul Data Science Undergraduates
    
  1.2 Problem/Motivation
    1.1.1 General Problem
      The human liver functions are crucial in maintaining everyday functions.  The liver synthesizes proteins, decomposes red blood cells, detoxifies the body, and produces homrmones. Liver cancer is not easily identifiable, the most important treatment is early diagnosis. 
      
    1.1.2 Objective
      The Objective of this project is to classify whether liver an individual is a liver patient or not.
      
    1.1.3 Importance
    
  1.3 Abstract

2 Literature Review (https://github.com/hgollakota/Research-fds/tree/master/Papers)
  2.1 Summary (Article 1) 
  2.2 Summary (Article 2) 
  2.3 Summary (Article 3) 

3 Methodology
  3.1 Dataset
    https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/ILPD+(Indian+Liver+Patient+Dataset)
    
    This ILPD (Indian Liver Patient Dataset) has 583 cases, composed of 416 liver patient records and 167 non-liver patient precords.
    From these patient records, there are 441 male patients and 142 female patients.
    THis is an unbalanced dataset.
    
    10 features,
      1) Age                (Continuous)
      2) Gender             (Categorical)
      3) Total Bilirubin    (Continuous)
      4) Direct Bilirubin   (Continuous)
      5) Total Protiens     (Continuous)
      6) Albumin            (Continuous)
      7) A/G Ratio          (Continuous)
      8) SGPT               (Continuous)
      9) SGOT               (Continuous)
      10)Alkphos            (Continuous)
      
      Label:
        Is Patient(Disease = 1, No Disease = 2)          (Categorical)
  
  3.2 Preprocessing
    Found 4 missing values, since the amount fo NaN < 5% we deicded to remove the tuples.
    Convert categorical variables into binary variables.
    
  3.3 Data Reduction
    Feature selection, either Principal COmponent Analysis(PCA) or Correlation Feature Selection (CFS).
    
  3.4 Classification Techniques
    3.4.1 K-NN
      K-Nearest Neighbor is the first algorithm we would like to explore.  Based on prior literature and kaggle kernals, this yields the most accurate model for our objective.
      
    3.4.2 Decision Tree
      With a decision tree, we are using a binary split because we have two levels of predictors
      
4 Evaluation
    4.4.1 Accuracy
    4.4.2 Sensitivity
    4.4.3 Specificity
    4.4.4 Training / Testing / Validation

5 Results
  5.1 Visualization
    5.1.1 Preprocessed
    5.1.2 Reduction
    5.1.3 Classification Outputs
    5.1.4 Testing CLassification Matrix
    5.1.5 Disect Dependent by Indepentent 

6 Conclusion & Future Work
  6.1 Numerosity Reduction
    Nonparametric Stratified Sampling to balance the data points.
  6.2 Compare to similiar dataset
